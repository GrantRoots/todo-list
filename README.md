# todo-list

Todo list is a project I made using javascript, html, and css. I used webpack to make everything. This project is a page where soemone can make projects and have different todo list items inside of them. They can edit everything, change the priority(color), add a due date and description to each todo item. They can also delete projects and todo items.
